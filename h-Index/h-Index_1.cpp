/**********************************************************************************

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

// How to do it:
// sort, then find the element

class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        if (citations.empty()){
            return 0;
        }
        sort(citations.begin(),citations.end(), greater<int>());
        int  len = citations.size();
        int i = 0;
        for (i = 0; i < len; ++i){
            if (i + 1 > citations[i]){
                return i;
            }
        }
        return i;
    }
};
